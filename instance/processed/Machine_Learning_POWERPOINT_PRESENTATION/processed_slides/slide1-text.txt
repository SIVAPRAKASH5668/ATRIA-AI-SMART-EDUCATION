Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning. It means the machine uses different layers to learn from the data.

In other words, deep learning involves the use of neural networks with multiple layers to analyze and interpret data. These layers allow the machine to learn complex patterns and relationships within the data, enabling it to make accurate predictions and decisions.

Some key characteristics of deep learning include:

* The use of multiple layers, which allows the machine to learn hierarchical representations of the data
* The ability to learn from large amounts of data, including images, speech, and text
* The use of neural networks, which are modeled after the human brain and consist of interconnected nodes (or "neurons") that process and transmit information.

Overall, deep learning has many applications in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, and has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries and fields.
