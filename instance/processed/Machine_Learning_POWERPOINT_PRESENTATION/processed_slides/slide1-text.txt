Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning. It means the machine uses different layers to learn from the data.

To break it down:

* Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is a broader field of study.
* In deep learning, machines use multiple layers (or "deep" layers) to process and learn from data.
* This layered approach allows machines to analyze complex patterns and relationships within the data, enabling them to make accurate predictions or decisions.
