Here is the organized and corrected content:

**The United States of America**
==========================

* A nation of diversity, power, and influence
* One of the most influential countries in the world
* Known for its political power, economic strength, cultural diversity, and global impact

From its founding in 1776 to its present-day status as a global leader, the USA has shaped the course of history, both domestically and internationally.

Note: I corrected the following errors:
- "Ameri¢a" to "America"
- "economi¢" to "economic"
- "imnact" to "impact"
- "dav" to "day"
- "aglobal" to "a global"
- Removed unnecessary symbols (®, *, », etc.) and formatted the text for better readability.
