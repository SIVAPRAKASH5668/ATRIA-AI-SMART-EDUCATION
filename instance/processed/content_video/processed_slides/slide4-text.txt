**Federal Republic**

The key components of a federal republic include:

1. **Separation of Powers**: The division of power between the three branches of government, which are:
	* **Executive**: The President, who is elected every four years.
	* **Legislative**: Congress, which creates and passes laws.
	* **Judicial**: The Supreme Court, which interprets laws and ensures they are consistent with the Constitution.

This system is designed to provide a balance of power and prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.
