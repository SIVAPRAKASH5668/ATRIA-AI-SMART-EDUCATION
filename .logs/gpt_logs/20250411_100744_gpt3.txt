{"query": "Mind-blowing relativity facts: - Time can appear to slow down or speed up depending on gravity and speed. - The faster you move, the slower time passes relative to a stationary observer. - If you were to travel at 90% of the speed of light for 5 years, 37 years would pass on Earth. - Gravity warps space and time, making objects fall along curved trajectories. - According to relativity, there's no universal 'now' \u2013 time is relative to the observer.", "response": "[[[0, 0.66], [\"Mind blowing\"]], [[0.66, 1.2], [\"relativity concept\"]], [[1.2, 2.12], [\"time facts\"]], [[2.12, 2.6], [\"time slow\"]], [[2.6, 3.3], [\"speed up\"]], [[3.3, 3.82], [\"gravity speed\"]], [[3.82, 4.36], [\"space time\"]], [[4.36, 4.92], [\"gravity speed\"]], [[4.92, 5.46], [\"fast motion\"]], [[5.46, 6.64], [\"the faster\"]], [[6.64, 7.42], [\"fast movement\"]], [[7.42, 7.96], [\"time passes\"]], [[7.96, 8.66], [\"stationary observer\"]], [[8.66, 9.1], [\"relative time\"]], [[9.1, 9.88], [\"still observer\"]], [[9.88, 10.42], [\"moving observer\"]], [[10.42, 11.86], [\"travel fast\"]], [[11.86, 12.28], [\"space travel\"]], [[12.28, 12.76], [\"high speed\"]], [[12.76, 13.66], [\"light speed\"]], [[13.66, 14.04], [\"fast light\"]], [[14.04, 14.24], [\"five years\"]], [[14.24, 14.78], [\"37 years\"]], [[14.78, 15.84], [\"years passing\"]], [[15.84, 16.52], [\"earth time\"]], [[16.52, 18.06], [\"gravity warps\"]], [[18.06, 18.64], [\"curved space\"]], [[18.64, 19.16], [\"time warp\"]], [[19.16, 20.04], [\"falling objects\"]], [[20.04, 20.62], [\"curved trajectory\"]], [[20.62, 21.64], [\"falling curve\"]], [[21.64, 22.94], [\"relativity concept\"]], [[22.94, 23.74], [\"no universal\"]], [[23.74, 24.22], [\"time concept\"]], [[24.22, 24.9], [\"no now\"]], [[24.9, 25.3], [\"relative time\"]], [[25.3, 26.22], [\"observer time\"]], [[26.22, 26.6], [\"observer view\"]]]", "timestamp": "2025-04-11T10:07:44.105623"}
